# Drumpad

The entire enclosure is 3D printed using an Ender 3 Pro using PLA using 0.2mm layer height.

## Assembly

Drumpad Base + Walls.stl and Drumpad Top.stl go together to make a single box. Inside are standoffs for the Drumpad LED pcb, and space for the actual brains of the instrument. Sensor Enclosure.stl is a model of for a Capsense sensor, just in case you want to adapt it to another design. Drumpad PCB plate .stl is a simple plate that screws underneath the Drumpad LED pcb with M3 screws and nuts if not using the original enclosure.

## Notes
Supports for a hole in the Drumpad Base + Walls.stl may or may not be required depending on the capabilities of your printing solution. Print with a brim if issues such as corners warping occur. Scaling may break how everything comes together, so if your print bed is not big enough, slice in half and put together with superglue or by other means.
