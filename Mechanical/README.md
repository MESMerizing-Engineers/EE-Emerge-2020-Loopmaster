# Hub
We designed a centralized hub to house everything from a powersupply to our finished boards. Changes had to be made from laser cutting to 3D printing, so the model had to be broken up into printable pieces.

# Camera
To mount the OpenMV H7 camera we used a STL file provided by OpenMV [here](https://openmv.io/collections/products/products/openmv-cam-h7-case) and modified it into a vertical mount with a ball and socket adjustment.
