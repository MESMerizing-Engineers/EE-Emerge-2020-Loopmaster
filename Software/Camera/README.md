# OpenMV Code
The software for tracking our camera instrument was developed in OpenMVide. This was a really straightforward IDE with tons of community activity. It had plenty of options to improve the code using computer learning algorithms and object identification. We tested a variety of different ways to track an object and found that using simple algorithms lead to in accurate readings, and using complex algorithms - TensorFLow or other computer training- to identify and track an object created too much of a delay. From those preliminary tests, we decided to simplify the object instead. We tracked an LED in grayscale and searched for areas in which the pixel value was white < [253]. To do this we used an algorithm provided in the openmv micropython libray call findblobs() you pass it threshold values to define what kind of blob and the size requirements. It will find all the blobs that meet that criteria, then we searched through those blobs to see if the center of any of those blobs fit inside certain areas of the screen (each corner). If a blob is in a corner we send the bela a code to play a note designated by that corner.
