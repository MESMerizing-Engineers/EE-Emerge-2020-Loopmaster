# FootPad

The FootPad is a large six input floor board where inputs are passed with a user's feet. The FoodPad manipulates the sounds created by the Camera Vision and Drumpad.

## Hardware

## Mechanical
The FootPad was created using 1/4" Plywood, 1/2" foam, copper tape, and screws. For each input, we wrapped one 4" x 1" x 1/4" Plywood pieces with copper tape and a 3" strip down the middle of two 6" x 24" x 1/4" Plywood pieces. The two pieces of plywood are then screwed together separated by 1/2" foam to prevent the copper tape from touching each other, creating a basic switch.

## Software
Software used for the FootPad is created using CCS Cloud / Energia and is loaded onto a MSP430.  It is the same as code used in the DrumPad.
