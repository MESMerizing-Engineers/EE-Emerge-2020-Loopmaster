Three in-house built instruments (DrumPad, Camera, and FootPad) work with selections specified in a MATLAB GUI communicating with a BeagleBone Black and Bela Capa.  The BeagleBone Black and Bela Cape is utilized to process user inputs and output different notes or chords.

### DrumPad
The Drumpad works like a traditional MIDI pad, where each of the twelve buttons are mapped to notes that relate to a selection of instruments.

### Computer Vision
The Computer Vision maps different notes to select areas in a camera's view and outputs sound when a trigger is visible.

### FootPad
The FootPad takes input from a user's feet and manipulates the sounds created by the Camera Vision and Drumpad.
